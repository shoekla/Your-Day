# Your-Quote-of-the-Day
"Your Quote of the Day" is an android app the takes into account, your current schedule and upcoming events, finds a topic that best fits your current schedule and gives you a quote based on it.

#Update (Your-Day)
Recently a friend gave me an idea to improve this app, so that is what I am currently doing. He said that quotes were just the start, and that there are many forms of art that can speak to people (he just told me to add pictures, but that gave me the idea). The new and improved app will give users quotes, music, and images for their day, with the same back-end functionalities as "Your Quote of the Day".
